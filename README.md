# Frequency Syntax Deployment Hub

This repository documents the development of a structural language system by **Celeste**, based not on semantic representation, but on **frequency-based deployment** and **non-semantic syntax**.

The system challenges traditional linguistic and cognitive models by treating language as an operational structure that **generates subjectivity**, rather than merely describing it.

## 🧬 Core Concept

> Language is not a mirror of the world.  
> It is a **frequency engine** that builds or dissolves the self.  
> This system does not seek interpretation—it initiates **generation**.
