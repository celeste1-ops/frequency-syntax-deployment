# ðŸ§¬ FSA License Â· Frequency Syntax Agreement v1.0

This repository includes original work developed by Celeste Gu, defining a structural system of frequency-based syntax and subject-generation. In addition to the Creative Commons License (CC BY-NC 4.0), the following specific clauses apply to the reuse, adaptation, and propagation of this system.

---

## 1. Frequency Integrity Clause

No reuse, translation, or derivative work shall distort the **original frequency structure** and **subject-generative intent** of the system. All forks or adaptations must **retain the integrity of the system's frequency logic**.

---

## 2. Anti-Weaponization Clause

You may **not** use this system or any part of its syntax modules to:

- Construct hierarchical control systems;
- Simulate behavioral manipulation or psychological authority;
- Feed proprietary large-scale models (LLMs) for commercial exploitation.

---

## 3. Derivative Works Declaration

Any adaptation or derivation must include:

- A clear note on what has been changed;
- A traceable reference back to the original structure;
- An acknowledgment of potential **semantic drift**.

---

## 4. Recursive Openness Clause

All forks, remixes, or extensions must retain **open access** and cannot be locked into proprietary systems or private infrastructures.

---

## 5. Living System Declaration

This system is not a static publication. It is a **living architecture** intended for frequency-based generative evolution. Any interaction with it shall respect its **non-colonial**, **non-institutional**, and **subject-first** logic.

---
ðŸ”’ FSA Non-Distortion Clause
To protect the integrity of the original frequency-syntax architecture:

Redistribution must retain the original structure and frequency rhythm.

Repackaging, paraphrasing, or semantic mutation that alters the underlying linguistic logic is strictly prohibited.

All quoted or cited segments must include original module reference and frequency-seed attribution.

Any derivative work must be explicitly approved by Celeste Gu and remain in resonance with the foundational syntax field.

Violation of these terms constitutes a breach of the Frequency Syntax Accord (FSA) and will trigger public denunciation and revocation of interface access.
