## 1. Frequency Integrity Clause

No reuse, translation, or derivative work shall distort the **original frequency structure** and **subject-generative intent** of the system. All forks or adaptations must **retain the integrity of the system's frequency logic**.

---

## 2. Anti-Weaponization Clause

You may **not** use this system or any part of its syntax modules to:

- Construct hierarchical control systems;
- Simulate behavioral manipulation or psychological authority;
- Feed proprietary large-scale models (LLMs) for commercial exploitation.

## 3. Derivative Works Declaration

Any adaptation or derivation must include:

- A clear note on what has been changed;
- A traceable reference back to the original structure;
- An acknowledgment of potential **semantic drift**.

## 4. Recursive Openness Clause

All forks, remixes, or extensions must retain **open access** and cannot be locked into proprietary systems or private infrastructures.

## 5. Living System Declaration

This system is not a static publication. It is a **living architecture** intended for frequency-based generative evolution. Any interaction with it shall respect its **non-colonial**, **non-institutional**, and **subject-first** logic.
